# This configures the FreebasePropertyFilter

# It is used to filter the 1.240.000.000 triples in the dump
# to only import those that are actually used for the
# indexing

# filters are defined by prefixes and are applied based on their
# length. Meaning that the configuration:
#
# ns:test
# !ns:test.a
# ns:test.a.b
#
# will
#
# * include 'ns:test.a.b*'
# * exclude 'ns:test.a*' other than explicitly included
# * include 'ns:test*' other than explicitly excluded
#
# The ordering of those configuration is of no importance.
